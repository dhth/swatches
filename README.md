`swatches` is a *(work-in-progress)* web-application that lets you experiment
with color schemes for web design.

It provides a controls section and a preview section. You can tweak colors in
the former and view the results in the latter. Once satisfied with your choices,
you can copy them to your clipboard.

Admittedly, the design of the preview section is tailored to the types of
websites I'm currently designing â€” flat, dark colors, rectangular elements, etc.

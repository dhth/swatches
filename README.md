`swatches` is a *(work-in-progress)* web-application that lets you experiment
with color schemes for web design.

It provides a controls section and a preview section. You can tweak colors in
the former and view the results in the latter. Once satisfied with your choices,
you can copy them to your clipboard. The controls section is resizable (look for
controls at the bottom right of the section).

Admittedly, the design of the preview section is tailored to the types of
websites I'm currently designing â€” quite flat, with rectangular elements, etc.
